# Bear Coin Bank :teddy_bear:

### Short description
The mechanism that I chose for the final project is a bear coin bank. When inserting coins, the bear's mouth opens and the coin slips inside the bank. I chose this project because it's both useful and adorable.

### Main components
* body;
* head;
* arm;
* eyes;
* bottom cap.

### How it works

The bear coin bank works by pushing the bear's ears, which elevates the hand with the tray, and the coin slips inside the bear's mouth. The coins can be collected by opening the bottom cap.
